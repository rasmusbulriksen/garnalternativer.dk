After completing a logical unit of work or making a set of related changes, always:

1. **Stage the changed files** using `git add` for the specific files that were modified
2. **Write a descriptive commit message** that clearly explains what was changed and why
3. **Commit the changes** with `git commit`
4. **Push to remote** with `git push` to keep the remote repository up to date

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
- Use clear, descriptive messages in the format: "What: Brief description of the change"
- Be specific about what was changed (e.g., "Add admin page for creating yarns" not just "Update files")
- Include context when helpful (e.g., "Fix price aggregation to use discounted prices")
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change or feature

**When to Commit:**
- After completing a feature or fix
- After making a set of related changes
- After refactoring a specific component or function
- After adding tests for a feature
- After updating documentation

**Avoid:**
- Large commits with multiple unrelated changes
- Generic commit messages like "Update" or "Fix"
- Committing without pushing (always push after committing)

This ensures a clean, readable git history with small, focused commits that are easy to review and understand.

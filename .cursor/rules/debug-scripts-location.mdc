When creating debugging scripts, temporary scripts, or one-off utility scripts for debugging purposes, always place them in the `backend/temp-debug-scripts/` directory. This includes:

- Debug scripts for inspecting database data
- Temporary scripts for testing queries
- One-off scripts for troubleshooting
- Scripts for debugging specific issues

Do NOT place debugging scripts in `backend/src/db/` or other source directories. Keep the source code directories clean and organized by placing all temporary debugging scripts in `backend/temp-debug-scripts/`.
